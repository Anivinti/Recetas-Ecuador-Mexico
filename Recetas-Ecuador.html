   <h4>Steps to Make it</h4>

   <h5>To make the dough</h5>
   <ol>
     <li>The dough is the most laborious part, so it is important to have time to prepare it. First it is necessary to cook the squash in a cup of water, until it softens.
     Once it has cooked, remove it, from the water and mash it.</li>
     <li>Place the flour with the baking powder in the form of a volcano . In the center, put eggs, butter and pumpkin puree.</li>
     <li>Mix the ingredients with your hands, adding the flour little by little towards the center of the volcano</li>
     <li>In case the dough continues to stick to the surface, little by little, more flour is added until a compact but smooth dough is obtained.</li>
     <li>When the dough has taken consistency it is wrapped in plastic wrap and left to rest for 20 minutes at room temperature</li>
